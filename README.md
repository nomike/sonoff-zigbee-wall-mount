# Sonoff Zigbee Wall Mount

Simple wall mount for Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB dongle plus dongles. Should fit both the P and E version. The front part has a cutout to allow the cooler-grill to be exposed. Could be taped to the wall with double sided sticky tape for exampel. Usful for when you want the dongle to be mounted higher up for better signal.

It fits the dongle snuggly.
