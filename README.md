Simple wall mount for Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB dongle plus dongles. Should fit both the P and E version. The front part has a cutout to allow the cooler-grill to be exposed. Could be taped to the wall with double sided sticky tape for example. Useful for when you want the dongle to be mounted higher up for a better signal.

It fits the dongle snuggly.
